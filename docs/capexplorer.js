// "Good for" buying guidance (PRD v2, Phase 3 — the single most-requested
// item from real user feedback on the Capability Explorer page: "which
// switch will let me control my dimmer relay?" should be answerable without
// knowing what a cluster is). Turns confirmed cluster+command evidence into
// short, plain-English use-case tags instead of requiring the reader to
// translate "0x0006 commands_received: on/off/toggle" into "this can act as
// a switch" themselves.
//
// Evidence bar is deliberately "same model, any firmware in the community
// database", not "this exact device's exact firmware" — firmware-exact
// coverage is sparse this early in the database's life, and a capability
// common to a whole product line essentially never disappears on one
// firmware revision. When every entry confirming a tag used a firmware
// other than the one actually asked about (see localFirmware), the tag
// still shows — it's real evidence, not a guess — but comes back with
// exactFirmware: false so the caller can render a small caveat rather than
// silently overclaim. This mirrors the "preserve uncertainty" principle
// used everywhere else in the Capability Explorer (see confidenceLabel,
// firmwareDependentCapabilities): real evidence is always shown, just never
// dressed up as more certain than it is.
// Labels intentionally stay close to the underlying evidence rather than
// the more marketing-flavored outcome names sometimes suggested (e.g.
// "Motion lighting" for a plain occupancy sensor) — a bare occupancy
// sensor has no evidence it can control a light itself, only that it can
// detect motion; a device only earns a "controls X" tag when this file
// has actually confirmed a command for X. Renamed a few labels below to
// closer match requested wording where that's a safe 1:1 (Scene control,
// Energy monitoring, Temperature sensing, Color control) without changing
// what evidence backs each one.
