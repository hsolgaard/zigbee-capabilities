// "Good for" buying guidance (PRD v2, Phase 3 — the single most-requested
// item from real user feedback on the Capability Explorer page: "which
// switch will let me control my dimmer relay?" should be answerable without
// knowing what a cluster is). Turns confirmed cluster+command evidence into
// short, plain-English use-case tags instead of requiring the reader to
// translate "0x0006 commands_received: on/off/toggle" into "this can act as
// a switch" themselves.
//
// Evidence bar is deliberately "same model, any firmware in the community
// database", not "this exact device's exact firmware" — firmware-exact
// coverage is sparse this early in the database's life, and a capability
// common to a whole product line essentially never disappears on one
// firmware revision. When every entry confirming a tag used a firmware
// other than the one actually asked about (see localFirmware), the tag
// still shows — it's real evidence, not a guess — but comes back with
// exactFirmware: false so the caller can render a small caveat rather than
// silently overclaim. This mirrors the "preserve uncertainty" principle
// used everywhere else in the Capability Explorer (see confidenceLabel,
// firmwareDependentCapabilities): real evidence is always shown, just never
// dressed up as more certain than it is.
// Labels intentionally stay close to the underlying evidence rather than
// the more marketing-flavored outcome names sometimes suggested (e.g.
// "Motion lighting" for a plain occupancy sensor) — a bare occupancy
// sensor has no evidence it can control a light itself, only that it can
// detect motion; a device only earns a "controls X" tag when this file
// has actually confirmed a command for X. Renamed a few labels below to
// closer match requested wording where that's a safe 1:1 (Scene control,
// Energy monitoring, Temperature sensing, Color control) without changing
// what evidence backs each one.
// `label` is the imperative-mood chip wording shown as a tag (unchanged,
// still used by useCaseTags/goodForHtml).
//
// `attribute` (command-kind rules only) is the noun form of what gets
// controlled — e.g. "on/off state", not "switch things on/off". This
// exists specifically to avoid a real ambiguity a first version of this
// sentence got wrong: "this device can switch things on and off" reads as
// "this device controls other things," which is only true if it has an
// OUTPUT declaration for that cluster (a separate, much rarer fact — see
// controlUseCases/directControlSummary). What a plain Input declaration
// actually means is that the device's OWN on/off state (its own relay or
// load) can be switched, and by two possible sources: Home Assistant, or
// another Zigbee device bound directly to it — e.g. a second switch using
// this device as a relay. deviceOverview() below always phrases these as
// "this device's <attribute> can be controlled by Home Assistant, or by
// another Zigbee device bound directly to it" for exactly that reason —
// never as an active verb with the device as the one doing the switching.
// Deliberately says nothing about what the on/off state is physically
// wired to (a hardwired lamp, a wired appliance, or nothing at all) —
// that's real-world context no scan can confirm and belongs in the
// per-cluster glossary explanation, not a claim this template makes up.
//
// `fragment` (presence-kind rules only) is the same idea for sensor
// clusters, which don't have this ambiguity — a temperature sensor
// reporting "the temperature it senses" is unambiguous regardless of
// what's nearby, so these stay as simple sentence fragments.
