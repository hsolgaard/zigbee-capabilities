// capexplorer.js are the complete pure data layer behind the Zigbee
// Capability Explorer, and both are meant to be lifted wholesale into
// something that isn't this card (see docs/, the standalone zigbee-
// capabilities website, which imports these two files directly and nothing
// else from src/). constants.js re-exports CAPABILITY_DB_REPO from here so
// card.js's existing imports keep working unchanged.

// The community-maintained, openly-licensed device capability database
// this card can submit "Check supported commands" scans to (see that
// repo's own README for the schema and review process). One constant so
// the target repo only needs updating in one place if it's ever
// renamed/moved — which already happened once (zha-device-capabilities ->
// zigbee-capabilities).

// *entire* capability set, not just what a binding controls — "X control"
// would read wrong for a sensor ("occupancy control" isn't a thing;
// "occupancy sensing" is). Anything not listed here falls back to the
